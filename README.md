# University Confessions ðŸ¤«

A place for university students to anonymously complain, confess, and relate about the stupid things we do.

## Summary of Project

University confessions is a project for COMP 230: Databases, at the University of The Fraser Valley. This project was supposed to demonstrate using a SQL database in a real-world situation.

### Goals of the project

Beyond the fact that University Confessions is a university project, we hope that university confessions can be a place for students to:

1. Connect and communicate with other university students anonymously.
2. Openly share their thoughts on university events, policies, and goings-ons.
3. Contribute without being subjected to racism, sexism, or general harassment.
